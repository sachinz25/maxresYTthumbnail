YouTube Thumbnail Viewer and Downloader
This is a simple Python script that allows you to view and download the thumbnail image of any YouTube video. The script extracts the video ID from a YouTube URL using regular expressions, and then generates the URL of the video's maximum resolution thumbnail image using the extracted ID. The image is then opened in a new window in your default web browser using the webbrowser module.

How to Use
To use the script, simply run the youtube_thumbnail_viewer.py file and enter a valid YouTube video URL when prompted. The script will then extract the video ID and generate the URL of the maximum resolution thumbnail image. The image will be opened in a new window in your default web browser.

Limitations
Note that the script may not work correctly for videos that have restricted access or have been removed from YouTube. Additionally, the maximum resolution thumbnail image may not always be available for a given video.
